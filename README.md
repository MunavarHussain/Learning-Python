# Learning-Python

At the start of this journey, I'm familiar with some basic python concepts.
I'm following the tutorials of Corey Schafer, a famous youtuber.

First few days I'm going to cover the OOP concepts.
Corey's channel has a series of 6 videos dedicated for OOP concepts alone, which I'm gonna follow along.

Tutorial 1 : Understanding Classes and Instances.

Tutorial 2 : Class variables.

Tutorial 3 - Class and static methods.
