First of all, what's a virtual environment?

Say, we work on a project 1 that depends on a package P with version V1.0. Now the project is over we move on to project 2 that requires P with version v2.0. So on the course of upgrading P's version project 1 maynot be compatible with the newer version.

So a virtual environment is created to install all dependencies for a particular project alone. Therefore each project can use its own version of a package without any problem.

Let's get started!
